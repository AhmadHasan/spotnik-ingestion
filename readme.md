### Retrieving Wikidata Subtypes

You can go to https://query.wikidata.org/ and run the query below.

Running the query with all types might cause an error, in that case run it in batches with a couple of types each time.

Some types have so many subtypes that you have to split within the same top type. Remove the star in the query to disable recursivity and retrieve the first level subtypes and repeat on this list. Please note that the topType in this case would be the direct parent of the subtype. You need to replace it (probably manually in the resulting data export) with the root type where it originates from.

```
SELECT ?topType ?subtype ?subtypeLabel WHERE {
VALUES ?topType {

}
```


You can clean the resulted data with this command:

```
grep -v '^topType' all.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{
split($1, a, "/");
split($2, b, "/");
print a[length(a)] "\t" b[length(b)] "\t" $3
}' > all_clean.tsv
```
